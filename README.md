# Intro
This is a log server - it provides a web page which displays logs which are POST to its server. This is a nice setup because we can have multiple ec2 instances POST to the server and see the results displayed on the webpage - we can get an overview of a process running on multiple machines.

# Run
## Frontend
```
npm i
npm run dev
```
